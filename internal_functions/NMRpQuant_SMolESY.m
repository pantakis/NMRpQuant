% Applying SMolESY filtering and produce SMolESY filter (i.e. modified
% SMolESY)
% 
% 
% Inputs
% X: PPM vector
% Y: Original Intensity Real data vector
% Y_imag: Original Intensity Imaginary data vector
% X_processed: PPM vector from the reprocessed NMR data (by new lb_factor)
% Y_imag_processed: Intensity Imaginary data vector from Reprocessed NMR data (by new lb_factor)  
% ref_position: PPM value to align Original and Reprocessed NMR data (e.g. 0 when using TSP)
% radius: Â±PPM value for searching/picking maximum peak (i.e. Ref Peak, e.g. TSP) to align NMR data
%
%
% Outputs 
% SMolESY_original: SMolESY data vector from the Original Imaginary data
%                   vector
% SMolESY_Processed_final: ABSOLUTE SMolESY data vector from the Re-processed 
%                          Imaginary data vector         
% SMolESY_filtered1D: Intensity data of the "SMolESY_Processed_final" vector subtraction 
%                     from Orignal Intensity data vector
